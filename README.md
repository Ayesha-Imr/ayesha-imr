hi, i'm ayesha

my life mainly revolves around tech, software, coding etc and i love it.

i like planning and building things (i enjoy building stuff from scratch sometimes just for the fun of it), i love getting deep into research especially related to AI and NLP, and contributing to open source is a huge passion of mine.

i also really enjoy connecting with like-minded people in tech:
